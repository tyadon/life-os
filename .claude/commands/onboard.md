# System Onboarding

Walk through a comprehensive onboarding to set up and customize the entire life operating system. This creates a fully personalized system - not just filling in templates, but actually configuring all commands, agents, and files for the specific user.

**Time required**: 60-90 minutes (can be done in multiple sessions)

**CRITICAL**: This onboarding will modify files throughout the system to customize them for this user. The template files are starting points that show the pattern - by the end, everything should be fully configured for this specific person's accounts, projects, and preferences.

---

## Phase 0: System Overview (~2 min)

First, understand the system structure by reading key files:
- Read `CLAUDE.md.template` to understand the expected context format
- Scan `/projects/work/_template.md` and `/projects/personal/_template.md` for project structure
- Check if `CLAUDE.md` already exists (partial onboarding)
- Check if `/reference/system-config.md` exists

Explain to the user:

"Welcome to LifeOS. I'm going to help you set up a complete personal operating system. This will take about an hour, but by the end you'll have:

- A fully configured AI assistant that knows your context
- Task management connected to your Google accounts
- Project tracking for everything you're working on
- Daily routines and habit tracking customized to your schedule
- Weekly and monthly review systems

**I'll be creating and modifying files throughout the system to customize everything for you specifically.**

Let's start."

---

## Phase 1: Google Account Setup (~10 min)

**This is critical - all task/calendar/email integrations depend on this.**

### Step 1.1: Discover Accounts

Ask:

"First, let's set up your Google accounts. These connect your tasks, calendar, and email.

1. What Google accounts do you use? List them all - personal gmail, work account, side project accounts, etc.
2. Which one is your PRIMARY personal account?
3. Do you have a work account? What's the email?
4. Any others?"

For each account, capture:
- Full email address
- Type (Personal / Work / Side Project / Other)
- What it's primarily used for

### Step 1.2: Verify MCP Access

For each account mentioned, try to verify access:
```
mcp__google-workspace__list_task_lists
  user_google_email: [their account]
```

If access fails, note it and continue - they may need to configure MCP after onboarding.

### Step 1.3: Project/Task Organization

Ask:

"Now let's understand how you want to organize your tasks:

1. What are the main areas or projects in your life right now? (work, side projects, personal, health, etc.)
2. For each area, which Google account should hold those tasks?
3. What should the task list be called in Google Tasks?"

Build a complete mapping:

| Project/Area | Google Account | Task List Name | Priority |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| [their input] | [their account] | [their choice] | H/M/L |

### Step 1.4: Create System Config

Create `/reference/system-config.md` with their ACTUAL configuration:

```markdown
# System Configuration

*Generated by onboarding on [DATE]*

## Google Accounts

| Account | Type | Primary Use |
|---------|------|-------------|
| [their-actual@email.com] | [Type] | [Description] |

## Project → Task List Mapping

| Project Slug | Google Account | Task List Name | Priority |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| [slug] | [email] | [list name] | [H/M/L] |

## Account Priority Order

1. [Their actual priority - e.g., work first for revenue-critical]
2. [etc.]

## Quick Reference

**Personal email**: [actual email]
**Work email**: [actual email or "N/A"]
**Default task account**: [account for misc tasks]
**Travel confirmations**: [account that receives travel emails]
```

---

## Phase 2: Life Audit (~15 min)

"Now let's get honest about where you are right now."

### Areas to Cover

**Physical Health** (1-10)
- What's driving that number?
- Current fitness routine?
- Energy levels?
- Sleep?
- Nutrition?

**Mental/Emotional** (1-10)
- Stress sources?
- Focus ability?
- Mindfulness practices?
- Phone/social media relationship?

**Professional/Career** (1-10)
- Current work situation?
- What's working?
- What's frustrating?
- 1-year and 5-year vision?

**Relationships** (1-10)
- Key people?
- Any needing attention?
- Connected or isolated?

**Financial** (optional, 1-10)
- Any specific goals?

### Create Life Audit File

Create `/reference/life-audit-[YYYY-MM-DD].md` with their ACTUAL responses, not templates.

---

## Phase 3: Vision & Goals (~15 min)

### 10-Year Vision
Ask them to describe their ideal future in vivid detail.

### Annual Goals
"Given that vision, what needs to be true one year from now?"
- Health goal (specific, measurable)
- Professional goal
- Personal/relationship goal
- What would make this year a success?

### Quarterly Goals
"For the next 90 days specifically:"
- Top 3 priorities
- What success looks like
- What you're NOT focusing on

### Create Goal Files

Create with their ACTUAL goals:
- `/reference/goals/[YYYY]-goals.md`
- `/reference/goals/q[Q]-[YYYY]-goals.md`

---

## Phase 4: Project Inventory (~10 min)

"Let's get all your projects into the system."

Ask:
- "What are you actively working on? List everything - work, personal, side projects."
- "For each: What's the goal? Current status? Which Google account has its tasks?"
- "Any projects to stop or pause?"
- "Any you want to start?"

### Create Project Files

For EACH active project they mention:
1. Determine if it's work or personal
2. Create `/projects/[work|personal]/[project-slug].md`
3. Fill in their actual project details, not placeholders
4. Link to the correct Google Tasks list from system-config.md

---

## Phase 5: Daily Rhythm & Habits (~10 min)

### Daily Rhythm

Ask:
- "What time do you want to wake up?"
- "What time do you want to be asleep?"
- "When's your best time for focused work?"
- "Any non-negotiable time blocks?"

**Update routine files with their actual times:**

Edit `/reference/routines/morning-routine.md`:
- Change "Target Wake Time: 5:30 AM" to their actual time
- Adjust workout schedule to their preferences

Edit `/reference/routines/evening-routine.md`:
- Change bedtime to their actual target
- Change screens-off time accordingly

### Habit Selection

Ask:
"What habits do you want to track daily? Here are common ones, but tell me what matters to YOU:"

Let them choose/customize. Common options:
- Wake on time
- Exercise
- Nutrition targets
- Deep work blocks
- Phone-free time
- Reading
- Meditation
- Evening routine
- Sleep on time

**Create `/reference/habits.md`** with THEIR chosen habits, numbered and described in their words.

---

## Phase 7: Preferences (~5 min)

Ask:
- "How aggressive should I be when you miss commitments? (1-10, where 10 is brutal honesty)"
- "Any topics off-limits for tough love?"
- "How much detail in morning briefs - quick hits or full context?"
- "Prefer emojis in output, or keep it clean?"

Note these in CLAUDE.md under an "Interaction Preferences" section.

---

## Phase 8: Verification (~5 min)

Before finishing, verify the setup works:

### 8.1: Test Google Access

For their primary account:
- Try listing task lists
- Try getting today's calendar
- Try searching recent emails

Note any access issues for troubleshooting.

### 8.2: File Review

Show them what was created/modified:

"Here's what I configured:

**Core Configuration:**

## Phase 9: Launch

"Onboarding complete! Your personalized LifeOS is ready.

**To start using it:**

---

## Multi-Session Support

If user needs to break:
- Note the current phase
- Save all progress so far
- Create `/reference/onboarding-progress.md` noting where they stopped

"We stopped at Phase [X]. Run `/onboard` again and tell me to continue - I'll pick up where we left off."

On next run:
- Check for `/reference/onboarding-progress.md`
- Check for partial artifacts (CLAUDE.md, system-config.md, etc.)
- Offer to continue or start fresh
