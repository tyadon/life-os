# Quarterly Review

Every 90 days, zoom way out. Deep strategic review and recalibration.

## Process

### 1. Gather All Data

This is comprehensive. Read:
- All `/reviews/monthly/` from the quarter
- All `/reviews/weekly/` from the quarter
- `/metrics/` folders for trends
- All project files (active and archived from this quarter)
- `/reference/goals/[year]-goals.md`
- `/reference/goals/[quarter]-goals.md`
- `/reference/goals/10-year-vision.md`
- Previous quarter's review if exists

### 2. Vision Alignment Check

Start with the 10-year vision:

"Read your 10-year vision. Does it still resonate? Has anything changed?"

Then: "Based on where you are now, are you moving toward that vision or away from it?"

Be honest. If there's drift, name it.

### 3. Quarterly Goal Review

For each goal set at the start of the quarter:

| Goal | Target | Result | Hit? |
|------|--------|--------|------|
| [Goal] | [Target] | [Actual] | ✅/❌ |

For each:
- If hit: What made it work?
- If missed: What blocked it? Was the goal realistic?

"Overall quarter assessment: [Grade A-F]"

### 4. Major Accomplishments

Look at the full quarter:
- What are you most proud of?
- What moved the needle most?
- What surprised you (positively)?

### 5. Major Failures

Be brutally honest:
- What did you commit to and not do?
- What patterns of failure repeated all quarter?
- What should you have done that you didn't?
- What excuses do you keep making?

"What would you do differently if you could restart this quarter?"

### 6. Key Learnings

"What did you learn about yourself this quarter?"

Categories:
- About your work style
- About your energy management
- About what motivates you
- About what drains you
- About your limits
- About your capabilities

### 7. System Effectiveness Review

Review the Life OS itself:
- What's working well in this system?
- What's not being used?
- What's missing?
- What commands/processes should be added?
- What should be simplified?

### 8. Next Quarter Planning

#### Set Q[X] 2026 Goals

Guide through goal setting:
- Max 3-5 major goals
- Must be specific and measurable
- Must connect to annual goals
- Must have clear success criteria

Format:
```markdown
