# Evening Routine

*Health Protocol - End of Day*

---

## Target Bed Time: 9:30 PM
## Screens Off By: 8:30 PM

---

## Phase 1: Work Shutdown (5:30-6:30 PM)

1. **Clear inbox** — Process to zero or defer intentionally
2. **Review tomorrow** — Quick look at calendar
3. **Capture loose ends** — Brain dump anything hanging
4. **Shutdown ritual** — Say "workday complete" (literally, out loud)

## Phase 2: Evening Window (6:30-8:30 PM)

Flexible time for:
- Dinner (protein-focused)
- Movement (walk, stretch)
- Reading (30+ min goal)
- Connection (calls, quality time)
- Personal projects and hobbies

Avoid:
- Heavy work tasks
- Stressful conversations
- Doom scrolling
- Alcohol (or very limited)

## Phase 3: Wind Down (8:00-8:30 PM)

1. **Claude Code: /evening-checkin** — Journal, reflection, and habit scoring
   - Freeform journaling first (talk about your day, what's on your mind)
   - Then structured reflection and habit scorecard
2. **Tomorrow prep** — Clothes, bag, coffee setup
3. **Reading** — Continue or complete 30 min goal

## Phase 4: Sleep Prep (8:30-9:30 PM)

1. **Screens off** — Phone on charger (not in bedroom)
2. **Dim lights** — Set sleep mode
3. **Cool room** — 65-68°F ideal
4. **Relaxation** — Reading (paper), light stretching, breathing
5. **Gratitude** — Three things, can be in head

## Lights Out: 9:30 PM

Aim for 8 hours of sleep (9:30pm → 5:30am = 8 hours)

---

## Evening Non-Negotiables

1. ✅ Screens off by 8:30 PM
2. ✅ Phone out of bedroom
3. ✅ Evening check-in completed
4. ✅ Tomorrow is prepped
5. ✅ In bed by 9:30 PM

---

## Minimum Viable Evening

For unusual days:

1. Quick capture of open loops
2. Brief evening check-in (can be abbreviated)
3. Phone away from bed
4. Sleep

---

## Sleep Optimization

- Consistent sleep/wake times (even weekends)
- No caffeine after 2 PM
- No heavy meals within 3 hours of bed
- Limit alcohol (disrupts deep sleep)
- Cool, dark, quiet room
- Consider sleep mask if needed

---

## Recovery Indicators

If you're consistently struggling to fall asleep or waking tired:
- Check caffeine timing
- Check screen time before bed
- Check stress levels (need more wind-down?)
- Check workout timing (not too late?)
- Check alcohol intake
