# Morning Routine

*Health Protocol - Start of Day*

## Target Wake Time: 5:30 AM

## Phase 1: Immediate (0-15 min)

1. **Alarm off, feet on floor** — No snooze, no negotiation
2. **Hydrate** — 16-20 oz water immediately
3. **Light exposure** — Open blinds or step outside briefly
4. **NO PHONE** — First hour is phone-free

## Phase 2: Movement (15-90 min)

Based on day of week:

| Day | Workout |
|-----|---------|
| Monday | Lower Body (Strength) |
| Tuesday | Upper Body (Push) |
| Wednesday | Conditioning + Core |
| Thursday | Lower Body (Hypertrophy) |
| Friday | Upper Body (Pull) |
| Saturday | Conditioning or Active Recovery |
| Sunday | Rest (stretch/mobility only) |

**Post-workout**:
- Cold shower (finish with 30-60 sec cold)
- Breakfast with protein (40-50g)

## Phase 3: Mind (90-120 min)

1. **Meditation** — 10-20 minutes
2. **Journaling** — Optional morning pages
3. **Claude Code: /morning-brief** — Daily planning with chief of staff

## Phase 4: Deep Work Block 1 (by 8:30 AM)
