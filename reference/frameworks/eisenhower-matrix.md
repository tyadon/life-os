# Eisenhower Matrix

## When to Use

Use this framework when you need to:
- Prioritize a long list of tasks
- Decide what to focus on vs. what to delegate or eliminate
- Feel overwhelmed with options
- Distinguish between urgent and important

## The Framework

Categorize every task into one of four quadrants:

```
                    URGENT                  NOT URGENT
              ┌──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┐
              │                      │                      │
              │      Q1: DO FIRST    │    Q2: SCHEDULE      │
   IMPORTANT  │                      │                      │
              │   • Crisis           │   • Planning         │
              │   • Deadlines        │   • Deep work        │
              │   • Problems         │   • Relationships    │
              │                      │   • Health           │
              │                      │   • Learning         │
              ├──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┤
              │                      │                      │
              │     Q3: DELEGATE     │    Q4: ELIMINATE     │
NOT IMPORTANT │                      │                      │
              │   • Interruptions    │   • Time wasters     │
              │   • Some meetings    │   • Busy work        │
              │   • Some emails      │   • Distractions     │
              │   • Other's urgency  │   • Escape activities│
              │                      │                      │
              └──────────────────────┴──────────────────────┘
```

### Step 1: List All Tasks

Write down everything on your plate. Don't filter yet.

### Step 2: Define "Important"

Important = Contributes to your long-term goals, mission, values
Ask: "Does this matter for where I want to be in a year? Five years?"

### Step 3: Define "Urgent"

Urgent = Requires immediate attention, has a deadline, consequences if delayed
Ask: "What happens if I don't do this today/this week?"

### Step 4: Categorize Each Task

For each item, ask:
- Is this urgent? (Yes/No)
- Is this important? (Yes/No)

Place in appropriate quadrant.

### Step 5: Take Action

- **Q1 (Urgent + Important)**: Do these first, today
- **Q2 (Not Urgent + Important)**: Schedule specific time blocks for these
- **Q3 (Urgent + Not Important)**: Delegate, batch, or minimize
- **Q4 (Neither)**: Eliminate ruthlessly

## Key Questions

- "If I could only do one thing today, what would move the needle most?"
- "Is this urgent because it's actually time-sensitive, or because someone else made it urgent?"
- "Am I doing this because it's important, or because it's easy?"
- "What Q2 activities am I neglecting that will become Q1 crises if I don't address them?"

## The Key Insight

Most people spend too much time in Q1 (firefighting) and Q3 (other people's urgencies).

The goal is to spend more time in Q2 (important but not urgent). This is where:
- Growth happens
- Problems are prevented
- Deep work occurs
- Relationships strengthen
- Health is maintained

Q1 shrinks when you invest in Q2.

## Example Application

**Scenario**: Overwhelmed Monday morning with 15 things "to do"

**Application**:
- Q1: Client deadline today, system outage to fix → Do first
- Q2: Strategic planning, workout, relationship call → Schedule for this week
- Q3: Meeting that could be an email, routine requests → Decline or batch to end of day
- Q4: Social media scroll, organizing already-organized files → Eliminate

**Result**: Clear focus on what matters, permission to ignore what doesn't
