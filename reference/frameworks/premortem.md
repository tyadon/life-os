# Premortem

## When to Use

Use this framework before committing to a significant decision or project. It helps identify risks and failure modes in advance so you can prevent them.

## The Framework

Unlike a post-mortem (analyzing failure after it happens), a premortem assumes failure and works backward to find the causes.

### Step 1: Assume Failure

"Imagine it's one year from now. This decision/project has failed completely. It was a disaster."

Really sit with this. Make it vivid. The project didn't just underperform — it failed.

### Step 2: Write the Story

"What happened? What caused the failure?"

Brainstorm all possible causes. Be creative and honest:
- What went wrong?
- What did we miss?
- What assumptions were wrong?
- What external factors intervened?
- What internal factors caused problems?
- What did we underestimate?
- What did we ignore because it was uncomfortable?

### Step 3: Categorize Causes

Sort the failure causes:
- **Controllable**: Things we could directly prevent
- **Influenceable**: Things we could mitigate but not eliminate
- **Uncontrollable**: Things we'd just have to accept or work around

### Step 4: Create Safeguards

For each controllable/influenceable cause:
- What specific action would prevent or mitigate this?
- Who is responsible for this safeguard?
- When does this need to happen?
- How will we know if it's working?

### Step 5: Make the Call

Given this analysis:
- Do the potential failure modes change the decision?
- Are the risks acceptable given the potential upside?
- Are we prepared to handle the risks we've identified?
- Should we proceed, modify our approach, or abandon?

## Key Questions

- What are we choosing not to see?
- What's the most likely cause of failure?
- What would make us say "we should have known"?
- Are there any deal-breaker failure modes?

## Key Insight

People are better at identifying problems with something that has "already failed" than predicting problems with something they're optimistic about. The premortem exploits this by changing the frame.

## Example Application

**Decision**: Launch a new product line

**Imagined Failure Causes**:
- Underestimated development time
- Market shifted during build
- Key team member left
- Didn't validate demand properly
- Ran out of cash before revenue

**Safeguards**:
- Add 50% buffer to timeline estimates
- Build in pivot points every 6 weeks
- Cross-train team members
- Pre-sell to 10 customers before building
- Set cash runway threshold that triggers pause
