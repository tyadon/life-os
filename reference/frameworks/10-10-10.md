# 10-10-10 Framework

## When to Use

Use this framework when facing decisions with emotional weight, values implications, or when short-term and long-term interests conflict.

## The Framework

For any decision, ask yourself three questions:

### Step 1: 10 Minutes
"How will I feel about this decision in 10 minutes?"

This captures:
- Immediate emotional reaction
- Short-term discomfort or pleasure
- Fear, excitement, anxiety
- The "right now" feeling

### Step 2: 10 Months
"How will I feel about this decision in 10 months?"

This captures:
- Medium-term consequences
- Will I still care about the short-term discomfort?
- What will have changed?
- What will I have learned?

### Step 3: 10 Years
"How will I feel about this decision in 10 years?"

This captures:
- Long-term significance
- Alignment with values and life direction
- What would I regret?
- What would I be proud of?

## Making the Decision

Usually, the 10-month and 10-year answers point to the right choice, even when the 10-minute answer is uncomfortable.

**If all three timeframes align** → Clear decision, proceed with confidence

**If short-term and long-term conflict** → Usually go with long-term (short-term discomfort often fades)

**If you're uncertain at 10 years** → The decision probably doesn't matter as much as you think

## Key Questions

- What would my future self wish I had done?
- Am I avoiding short-term discomfort at the cost of long-term regret?
- What matters more: how I feel right now or who I become?

## Example Application

**Decision**: Should I have a difficult conversation with a team member about their performance?

- **10 minutes**: I'll feel anxious and uncomfortable
- **10 months**: I'll be glad I addressed it early, the team will be stronger
- **10 years**: I won't remember the discomfort, but I'll remember if I failed to lead

**Answer**: Have the conversation.
